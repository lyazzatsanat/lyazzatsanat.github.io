I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Agricultural and Resource Economics at North Carolina State University. 

My doctoral research investigates the economics of adopting and diffusing conservation practices—such as cover cropping, no-till, and enhanced efficiency fertilizers—and evaluates how agri-environmental policy designs influence these decisions. Using remote sensing data and applied econometric methods, I assess the heterogeneous impacts of policy instruments, including state cost-share programs and crop insurance discounts, in promoting long-term changes in land management through short-term incentives. Part of my research involves interdisciplinary collaboration with crop and soil scientists to evaluate the agronomic, environmental, and economic viability of enhanced efficiency fertilizers and their potential to remain viable without continued subsidies. More broadly, my work seeks to advance a more integrated understanding of how policy, technology, and farmer behavior interact to shape the sustainability and resilience of agricultural systems.

      This study examines the role of state-led conservation programs in promoting cover crop
adoption in the United States (US). Utilizing county-level satellite data on cover crop acres from
16 US states between 2005 and 2020, our study employs a staggered difference-in-differences
(DiD) framework to estimate the impacts of these programs on cover crop uptake. The findings
reveal that state programs significantly increase initial short-term adoption of cover crops.
However, there is evidence that the strong initial adoption impact of state programs is generally
not sustained over the longer term several years after the introduction of the state program.
Bolstering state-level conservation programs offers a practical pathway to accelerate cover crop
adoption rates and meet environmental goals in the short-term, especially since these programs
are flexibly designed and tailored to local needs. Nonetheless, program design adjustments or
new policy instruments may be needed to sustain further adoption over the long-run.
