"Promoting Cover Crop Use in the United States: The Role of State-led Incentive Programs," with Roderick M. Rejesus
<!-- Collapsible Abstract --> 
<details> <summary style="cursor: pointer; font-weight: bold;">Abstract</summary> <p style="margin-top:10px;"> [This study examines the role of state-led conservation programs in promoting cover crop adoption in the United States (US). Utilizing county-level satellite data on cover crop acres from 16 US states between 2005 and 2020, our study employs a staggered difference-in-differences (DiD) framework to estimate the impacts of these programs on cover crop uptake. The findings reveal that state programs significantly increase initial short-term adoption of cover crops. However, there is evidence that the strong initial adoption impact of state programs is generally not sustained over the longer term several years after the introduction of the state program. Bolstering state-level conservation programs offers a practical pathway to accelerate cover crop adoption rates and meet environmental goals in the short-term, especially since these programs are flexibly designed and tailored to local needs. Nonetheless, program design adjustments or new policy instruments may be needed.] </p>
