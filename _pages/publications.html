  <h3><b>Promoting Cover Crop Use in the United States: The Role of State-led Incentive Programs</b></h3>
  <p><i>with Roderick M. Rejesus</i></p>
  <p class="abstract">
    [This study examines the role of state-led conservation programs in promoting cover crop
adoption in the United States (US). Utilizing county-level satellite data on cover crop acres from
16 US states between 2005 and 2020, our study employs a staggered difference-in-differences
(DiD) framework to estimate the impacts of these programs on cover crop uptake. The findings
reveal that state programs significantly increase initial short-term adoption of cover crops.
However, there is evidence that the strong initial adoption impact of state programs is generally
not sustained over the longer term several years after the introduction of the state program.
Bolstering state-level conservation programs offers a practical pathway to accelerate cover crop
adoption rates and meet environmental goals in the short-term, especially since these programs
are flexibly designed and tailored to local needs. Nonetheless, program design adjustments or
new policy instruments may be needed to sustain further adoption over the long-run.

  <h3><b>Yield and Economic Impacts of Enhanced Efficiency Nitrogen Fertilizers: Evidence from a Bayesian Meta-Analysis</b></h3>
  <p><i>with Roderick M. Rejesus and Alex L. Woodley</i></p>
  <p class="abstract">
    [This study employs a Bayesian meta-analysis to evaluate the yield and economic
impacts of four major categories of enhanced efficiency nitrogen fertilizers (EENFs)
within North American corn production systemsâ€”nitrification inhibitors (NIs), urease
inhibitors (UIs), dual inhibitors (DIs), and controlled release fertilizers (CRFs). The
analysis synthesizes data from 60 field experiments, revealing an average yield increase
of 3.24% for corn produced with EENFs compared to conventional nitrogen fertilizers.
All EENF types performed better under management conditions prone to nitrogen
losses. NIs were particularly effective in fine-textured soils, UIs in coarse-textured soils,
while DIs exhibited inconsistent yield improvements across most conditions. Economic
analysis indicated that NIs and UIs generally lead to positive net returns, while DIs
and CRFs presented mixed profitability outcomes. The variability in yield and profit
outcomes from using the different EENFs may be the reason for the relatively low
adoption levels observed in the United States (US). This research provides critical
insights into the potential viability of some EENF types for sustainable agriculture,
underscoring the need for better understanding and communicating their economic and
agronomic advantages to facilitate further adoption. The findings serve as valuable
guidance for policymakers and farmers aiming to optimize nitrogen fertilizer use while
enhancing agricultural productivity and environmental sustainability.
